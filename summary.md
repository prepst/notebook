<analysis>
The user requested a multiplayer infinite canvas using tldraw. Initially, I attempted to build a custom FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence and WebSocket synchronization, which resulted in a complex implementation with persistence bugs. After user feedback pointing to the official tldraw approach, I simplified the implementation to use tldraw's built-in `useSyncDemo` hook, which connects to tldraw's demo server at https://demo.tldraw.xyz. This reduced the implementation from hundreds of lines across multiple files to approximately 15 lines of code in a single component. The final implementation successfully provides real-time multiplayer collaboration with automatic persistence, user presence indicators, and all standard tldraw drawing tools.

Subsequently, three major features were added:

1. AI Chat Integration: Claude Sonnet 4 integration via Emergent Universal LLM Key, with AI responses creating text shapes directly ON THE CANVAS (not in a sidebar). Users can press Cmd+K to focus the prompt input and see streaming responses appear as canvas shapes synced across all users.
2. PDF Upload & RAG: Complete PDF upload infrastructure with Supabase storage, text extraction via pdfplumber, chunking, embedding generation using OpenAI (via litellm for Emergent key compatibility), and vector storage in Supabase pgvector. Frontend includes upload UI with progress tracking and toast notifications.
3. Handwriting Frame Capture: Auto-frame handwriting feature with keyboard shortcut 's' that creates frames around selected handwriting strokes, groups them, prevents resizing, and automatically captures PNG snapshots that are uploaded to the backend server.

- Clean, minimal implementation
  </product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
**Languages and Runtimes:**

- JavaScript/JSX (React)
- Node.js runtime for React development server

**Frameworks and Libraries:**

- React 19.0.0 - Frontend framework
- tldraw 4.1.2 - Canvas drawing library
- @tldraw/sync - Multiplayer synchronization library
- Create React App with craco - Build tooling

**Design Patterns:**

- React Hooks pattern (`useSyncDemo` for state management)
- Component composition
- Declarative UI rendering

**Architectural Components:**

- React component tree
- WebSocket client (managed by tldraw)
- Remote store synchronization (managed by tldraw)

**External Services:**

- tldraw demo server (https://demo.tldraw.xyz) - Handles WebSocket connections, synchronization, and persistence
- tldraw image worker (https://images.tldraw.xyz) - Asset optimization and serving
  </key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
**Architecture Overview:**
Simple client-only architecture. React frontend connects directly to tldraw's demo server via WebSocket. The `useSyncDemo` hook manages store creation, WebSocket connection, synchronization protocol, and persistence automatically. No custom backend required.

**Data Flow:**

1. User opens application → React component mounts
2. `useSyncDemo` hook initializes → Creates TLStore, connects to wss://demo.tldraw.xyz/connect/default
3. Server sends initial canvas state → Local store hydrated
4. User draws → Local store updated → Change broadcast to server → Server broadcasts to all connected clients
5. Remote changes received → Applied to local store → UI re-renders

**Directory Structure:**
No new directories created. Modified existing React application structure.

**Files Modified or Created:**

1. **File:** `/app/frontend/src/App.js`

   - **Purpose:** Root application component
   - **Changes:** Simplified to render only Canvas component, removed complex state management and Toaster
   - **Key Functions:** `App()` - default export returning Canvas component
   - **Dependencies:** React, Canvas component

2. **File:** `/app/frontend/src/components/Canvas.jsx`

   - **Purpose:** Main canvas component implementing multiplayer functionality
   - **Changes:** Complete rewrite to use `useSyncDemo` instead of custom WebSocket implementation
   - **Key Functions:**
     - `Canvas()` - Component that initializes tldraw with multiplayer sync
     - `useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'default' })` - Hook that returns synchronized store
   - **Dependencies:** React, tldraw, @tldraw/sync
   - **Implementation:**

     ```jsx
     import { Tldraw } from "tldraw";
     import { useSyncDemo } from "@tldraw/sync";

     export default function Canvas() {
       const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: "default" });
       return (
         <div style={{ position: "fixed", inset: 0 }}>
           <Tldraw store={store} />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **File:** `/app/frontend/src/App.css`

   - **Purpose:** Global application styles
   - **Changes:** Reset styles for full-viewport layout
   - **Key Styles:** Reset margins/padding, set html/body/#root to 100% height/width, hide overflow

4. **File:** `/app/frontend/package.json`
   - **Purpose:** NPM package configuration
   - **Changes:** Added tldraw 4.1.2 and @tldraw/sync 4.1.2 dependencies
   - **Dependencies Added:**
     - tldraw@4.1.2 (952 transitive dependencies)
     - @tldraw/sync@4.1.2

**Files Removed/No Longer Used:**

- `/app/frontend/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` (old complex implementation)
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.css`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/Canvas/ConnectionStatus.jsx`
- `/app/backend/server.py` (custom FastAPI backend no longer needed)
- `/app/frontend/src/index.css` (design system tokens no longer needed)

**Backend Components:**
FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence was implemented but is no longer used. The tldraw demo server handles all backend functionality.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
**User-Requested Features Not Implemented:**

1. URL-based room routing - User asked "how do i invite my friends?" and suggested private rooms via URL paths like `/room/team-a`. Currently all users join the same 'default' room.

**Issues Identified But Not Resolved:**
None - current implementation is fully functional.

**Potential Future Improvements:**

1. Custom room IDs from URL parameters (e.g., read from `window.location.pathname` or query string)
2. Room management UI (create room, copy invite link, room list)
3. Custom branding/styling beyond default tldraw theme
4. Self-hosted sync server instead of tldraw demo server (for production use, as demo server deletes data after ~24 hours)
5. Custom asset storage (currently uses tldraw's demo server)
6. Authentication/authorization for room access
7. Export functionality (PNG/SVG downloads)
8. Room persistence configuration (demo server has limited retention)
   </pending_tasks>

<current_work>

**Known Issues:**
None - application is fully functional as designed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
**Most Logical Next Action:**
Implement URL-based room routing to allow users to create and share private rooms.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add React Router to handle URL paths
2. Extract room ID from URL path (e.g., `/room/:roomId`)
3. Pass dynamic room ID to `useSyncDemo({ roomId })`
4. Add landing page with "Create Room" button that generates unique room ID
5. Display shareable link for current room
6. Add room ID to browser URL when room is created/joined

**Code Changes Required:**

```jsx
// Install: yarn add react-router-dom

// App.js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, useParams, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function RoomPage() {
  const { roomId } = useParams();
  return <Canvas roomId={roomId || 'default'} />;
}

function LandingPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const createRoom = () => {
    const roomId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
    navigate(`/room/${roomId}`);
  };
  return <button onClick={createRoom}>Create New Room</button>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
        <Route path="/room/:roomId" element={<RoomPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// Canvas.jsx
export default function Canvas({ roomId }) {
  const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId });
  return <div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}><Tldraw store={store} /></div>;
}
```

This would enable private rooms while maintaining the simple implementation approach.
